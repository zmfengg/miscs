The context allocation routine failed when it tried to load localization files!!
One or more following problems may caused the failure

Your sybase home directory is C:\sybase. Check the environment variable SYBASE if it is not the one you want!
Using locale name "en_US.UTF-8" defined in environment variable LANG
Locale name "en_US.UTF-8" doesn't exist in your C:\sybase\locales\locales.dat file
